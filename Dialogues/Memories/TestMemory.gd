"All of them suddenly stop laying eggs.", 
"So he calls a physicist, an engineer, and a mathematician to help solve the problem.",
"The physicist goes into the chicken coop, examines everything, and comes out. He says, 'I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.'",
"The engineer then goes in, tinkers with the coop and the feeding system, and says, 'I can get the chickens to lay eggs, but only at a 75% efficiency rate.'",
"Finally, the mathematician goes into the coop. He looks around, scribbles some equations on a piece of paper, and comes out.",
"He hands the farmer the paper and says, 'I've found a solution! Now, let's assume the chickens are points in a 4-dimensional space...'"]
